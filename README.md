## Based on the _evohome-client_

An Evohome browser based dashboard based on python. It can be run from any device capable of running Python scripts, but it was developed for a Raspberry Pi. The dash shows each of the user's devices, coloured according to their actual temperature vs their setpoint temperature. It is fully interactive, allowing the user to:

1. Set the temperature of all devices (zones and hot water)
2. Set the mode for the Evohome Controller (Auto, Economy, Away, Day Off, Custom, Off)
3. Backup and restore the user's schedule
4. Identifies which device is hotter/cooler than expected (device colour)
5. Displays which device is actively on (LED)
6. Shows the status of each device (Auto/Temporary Override)
7. Captures the Setpoint (target) temperature of each device
8. Shows when the device will change and the temperature it will change to (e.g. 22:00 > 16C) 

The application is very lightweight, all html is dynamically generated by the evopi.py script (40kb).
